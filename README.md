# 🔢 Number Guessing Game App

This is a **Number Guessing Game App** built with **React Native** that challenges your device to guess the number
you’ve chosen. The app takes multiple turns to find the correct number, and when it does, it tells you exactly how many
tries it took!

## 📖 Overview

The **Number Guessing Game App** is a fun and interactive project where the app itself plays the role of the guesser.
The user secretly chooses a number, and the app uses logical steps to **guess the number through multiple rounds**.

Once the correct number is guessed, the app displays how many attempts were made — and allows the user to start again
for endless replayability.

## 🎮 Gameplay

1. The user enters a number at the start of the game.
2. The app begins to make guesses.
3. The user provides hints (whether the number is higher or lower).
4. The app continues guessing until it finds the correct number.
5. When guessed correctly:
    - 🎯 The correct number is revealed.
    - 🔢 The total number of guesses is displayed.
6. The user can restart and play again as many times as they like.
