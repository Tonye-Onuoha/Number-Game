## 📖 Overview

This app is an interactive number game built with **React Native** (and optionally **Expo**).
The concept is simple yet engaging — the user thinks of a number, and the app takes multiple turns to **guess the
correct number**.

The goal of the game is for the app to determine the user’s number in as few tries as possible.

## 🎮 Gameplay

1. The user enters a number of their choice.
2. The app begins to **guess** the number using a logical approach.
3. The user provides feedback (higher or lower) until the app guesses correctly.
4. Once the correct number is guessed, the app displays:
    - 🎯 The correct number
    - 🔁 The number of attempts it took
5. The user can then replay the game as many times as they wish.
